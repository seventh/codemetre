oOo Compilation environment to use under Windows XP/Vista oOo

This directory contains a project description file to use with Code::Blocks (http://www.codeblocks.org)
It is compatible with 8.02 version supporting MinGw environment (available at http://downloads.sourceforge.net/codeblocks/codeblocks-8.02mingw-setup.exe)
This project files uses the two stubs located in src/c/bouchon, as I currently suppose that gettext support is not widely available.
